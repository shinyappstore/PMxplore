# PMxplore: Effortless Pharmacokinetic Dataset Exploration and NCA

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/PMxplore](https://shinyappstore.com/a/PMxplore)__

PMxplore is an application designed for the exploration of pharmacokinetic datasets, offering interactive visualizations and summaries of dependent variables, dosing regimens, and covariates. In the realm of pharmacokinetics, which involves studying how the body processes drugs, a dataset typically comprises information on drug concentrations, dosing schedules, and various patient-related factors. Dataset exploration and visualization involve comprehensively understanding and presenting patterns, trends, and distributions within the data. PMxplore, as part of the PopkinR suite developed by Scientists at the Sanofi Research and Development Facility. Additionally, PMxplore sets itself apart by allowing users to perform non-compartmental analysis, a method in pharmacokinetics that evaluates drug exposure without assuming a specific compartmental model. This analysis yields essential parameters such as area under the curve and maximum concentration, providing crucial data insights.
